# Wall-Follower-mobile-robot-using-Python-and-CoppeliaSim

This project examines the Pioneer 3dx named robot’s movement, it’s attitude towards the wall, and tracking along the wall using the robot simulation platform named CoppeliaSim(VREP) with the help of Python language. It is aimed to measure the distance of the robot to the wall and maintain its proximity to the wall by using almost every sensors. It is aimed to measure and regulate the attitude of the robot against the wall by increasing and decreasing the power coming to the motors with the activation of the sensors. Although the robot’s wall tracking has been successful, it is clear that there are some problems with the robot’s acceleration and deceleration after detecting the wall. However, there is no barrier for it to be turned into a machine that moves more smoothly by working on it.
